# Changelog

## 0.1.0-dev (unreleased)

- Project audit of the desktop repository (`docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md`).
- Gradle project with `:core` (pure Kotlin) and `:app` (Android, Compose).
- Agent core: planner, executor, tool registry, risk levels, native confirmation bound to the exact action, audit log, secret redaction.
- Cloud providers: Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, OpenAI and Claude with ordered fallback; https only.
- Android tools: flashlight, alarm, open link, open YouTube, device info.
- Removed (scope change to a standalone phone-only product): the Ollama provider, the private-network/cleartext exception and any desktop pairing plan.
- 138 offline unit tests pass in a non-Gradle harness. Gradle build, the `:app` module and device behaviour are unverified.
